# Motorcycle Specs Scraper

I love the data on the website motorcyclespecs.co.za from my South African compatriots. It's my goto place to find motorcycle info, even if its a little clunky and sometimes wrong. 

I also love spreadsheets. Google Sheets is the most useful cognitive tool I know of. I'd love to have a giant spreadsheet with specs of all the motorcycles I'm interested in.

This project scrapes data from motorcyclespecs.co.za into a nice spreadsheet format.


## Sources of Motorcycle Data

There's more than just motorcyclespecs.co.za. Here's a few useful websites. They don't always agree, which is just infuriating:

- https://www.motorcyclespecs.co.za/
- https://www.webbikeworld.com/
- https://www.ultimatespecs.com/motorcycles-specs
